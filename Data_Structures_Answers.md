Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your ring buffer's `append` method?
    Ans: O(1)

2. What is the space complexity of your ring buffer's `append` function?
    Ans: O(n)

3. What is the runtime complexity of your ring buffer's `get` method?
    Ans: O(n)

4. What is the space complexity of your ring buffer's `get` method?
    Ans: O(n)

5. What is the runtime complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?
    Ans: O(n^2)

6. What is the space complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?
    Ans: O(n)
     Worst case, if name sets are exact duplicates, then 'duplicates' array will have to hold 'n' names

7. What is the runtime complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?
    Ans: O(n)

8. What is the space complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?
    Ans: O(2n)
    Worst case, Binary Search Tree holds n values, and if name sets are exact duplicates, then 'duplicates' array will have to hold 'n' names.
